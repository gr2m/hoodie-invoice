About Hoodie
------------

[Hoodie](http://hood.ie) is an open source architecture
that provides common backend tasks as a beautifully crafted
JavaScript API. 

The Hoodie backend is implemented with [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)
and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and it's easily extendable
in case additional modules would be required.
